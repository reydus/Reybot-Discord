    This class is iterable, and yields data portions as `bytes` objects and

    Asynchronous iteration awaits for more events to come.

    :ivar closed: True if this Tail object has been closed. False initially.

    :Limitations:

    * Truncation detection is unreliable in general. It is primarily tracked by
      file size decrease, which sometimes can be unreliable. In cases when a file
      grows large and is truncated seldom, this is sufficient.

    * Asynchronous tracking is done at timer events (0.01 seconds currently).
      Inotify support could solve this issue on linux. Feel free to suggest other
      solutions.
